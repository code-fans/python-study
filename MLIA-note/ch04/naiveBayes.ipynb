I can't id the material but it looks a lot like concrete. I just haven't seen concrete castings of this quality or showing this much detail. Truly a one of a kind piece for the hard core Macintosh fan/evangelist. Don't let this one slip past you.You may not see another one.<br>\\n<br>\\nSorry, no keyboard, mouse, boot disks, software, or cord. A little dirty, excellent condition. Only chip I could find is pictured below. Very heavy and as solid as the rock it is...<br>\\n<br>\\nSerious MAC inquiries only.<br>\\n<br>\"},\n",

In our home we are not bound by those silly economic rules that everyone else has. We get free cable, electricity, water and our garbage is so good, the city pays us to take it!!!!!! We are just passing the savings on to you. Drama free!<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\nOur home is spotless clean. It takes no effort on your part to keep it that way. It is completely out of the question to hold you to such a high standard. We will merrily pick up after you. We have nothing better to do.<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\nPlease forgive us for the previous ad requesting that you not have pets. We were soo wrong to assume your ferret has a slight odor. I don\\'t know what got in to me. There is no way your precious dog could ever scratch my wood floors or kill my grass. Thank goodness Spot was there to alert me to the water utility truck at 2 am. Your dog is far more reliable than my Sig Sauer. It is perfectly cool to have your FIVE well taken care of cats stay in your room when you are away. Our friends and family will never be so rude as to comment on the smell of the litter box. We understand how theraputic your pets are at working through your commitment issues and filling in that hole in your heart where a family should be. <br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\nI think your perfectly safe snake would open my children\\'s eyes to the wonder of the animal kingdom. I look forward to the helicopter ride and the days of anxiety wondering if the anti venom took because my young daughter reached for a wild snake that was not as tame as your pet instead of running away.<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\nAll you young adults thinking about saving an animal and practicing for kids, STOP! If you are not grown enough to keep your credit card balance low, you can not handle a pet. Pets get fleas, ring worm, broken limbs and the fur can clog your air conditioning coils which can cost you $250 for an HVAC guy to scrub your coils.

Sex costs money. The more sex you want, the more it will cost. You can skirt the bill for a little while and then the big total eventually catches up to you.

Your next upgrade would be professional full service massages and their courteous pimps. If you are still not sure if you are ready for the top of the line sex, you can try the fiance\\' mode for a while, but be carefull with the early termination charges. If you want the whole enchilada, go for the wife. This is the most expensive sex you can have and thusly the best.

In our home we are not bound by those silly economic rules that everyone else has. We get free cable, electricity, water and our garbage is so good, the city pays us to take it!!!!!! We are just passing the savings on to you. Drama free!<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\nOur home is spotless clean. It takes no effort on your part to keep it that way. It is completely out of the question to hold you to such a high standard. We will merrily pick up after you.

Your dog is far more reliable than my Sig Sauer. It is perfectly cool to have your FIVE well taken care of cats stay in your room when you are away. Our friends and family will never be so rude as to comment on the smell of the litter box.

       "  'summary': '\"Update\" Thank to everyone who has graciously offered my parents a place to stay. Luckily my brother\\'s home has survived, and they have decided to stay with him while they rebuild their lives.<br>\\nWhen this first happened my mom said she felt she had been erased and no one noticed. She has been in much better spirits seeing these responses.<br>\\n<br>\\nMy parents lost their home in the Tubbs fire yesterday. They almost did not make it out alive and left with their dogs and what they were wearing. They have nothing left. Both of them work in Santa Rosa full time. They are not looking for anything for free. They are just looking for some hospitality or some privacy. They are currently staying at the Sheraton in Petaluma. After searching all day yesterday they were lucky to book this hotel after many reservations were cancelled. In their worst or times the hotel and many who were not affected by the fire have not been at all hospitable. If anyone reading this has an air bnb rental or anything my parents can rent, they would greatly appreciate it. I am hoping there is someone out there who can make them feel welcome or just give them as much privacy and space as possible. They were homeowners who had just finished remodeling their home themselves, across from Coffey park, when it was all taken away within hours. Seeing my mother cry while she closed her burnt mail box, the only thing left standing, was something I will never forget. Please contact me if you have an available rental outside of the evacuation areas or know someone that does. Thank you.<br>\\n<br>',\n",

Video collection now appears to have an owner (also from Beaverton) and awaiting an appointment for him to come and have the collection hauled off.  Thank you to all who\\'ve participated.  And I\\'ll try to find you that Texas Chainsaw Massacre video tape Ryan from Arkansas! ****<br>\\n<br>\\nGreetings all!<br>\\n<br>\\nMy name is Don; from Feb, 1987 [left the Navy in January,\\'87 USS Saginaw (LST-1188)- I got my 1st VCR from Circuit City in Norfolk Va. in November/December of 1986] to very early 2014 I video recorded (VHS) television shows of all kinds- news, magazine shows, David Letterman, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, It\\'s Gary Shandling\\'s Show (the 1/2 hr. comedy show where he was a condo/home owner and had fun with HOA), Siskel and Ebert movie review broadcasts, lotsa\\' MTV, etc. etc.- using my bank of 12 VCRs and being a virtual slave to VHS purchasing, labeling, and programming. Videotaping was everyday, not just sporadically. I kept the taping continuous and constant. <br>\\n<br>\\nThe tapes are arranged in both chronological and numerical order (for example, you can see what the world was doing on a particular date). They are divided into categories, ie, Jay Leno, News, News & Nightline, Today Show, etc. Sports? Just x-games, superbowls, and some Olympics coverage. I feel my video tape collection has some worth, ie, its fascinating to look at TV shows of the past when they were originally presented and see the \"outdated\" commercials or simply to see living history; I am not married and have no one to really pass them on to (I\\'m 62). I\\'m looking to give the collection- free of charge naturally- to someone who would appreciate owning this collection and giving it some \"TLC.\"  NOTE:  Due to feedback I\\'m getting I guess I must state I\\'m pretty much requiring that the collection be taken as a whole- not just part of the collection be taken, i.e.,  I\\'ve had interest in just Johnny Carson tapes or early MTV (before it went south).  What you do with the collection after that is your business.  <br>\\n <br>\\nDo you have enough room/shelving in your home or storage for these tapes? Tapes are stored in boxes (mostly bicycle boxes); shipment/transportation is at receivers expense. I advise U-hauling. <br>\\n<br>\\nNumber of tapes: approx. 23-24,000 (consists primarily of 6 and 8 hr Sony and TDK tapes). <br>\\n<br>\\nSome more pictures of my collection:<br>\\n<br>\\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/52611635@N06/sets/72157624674915460/<br>\\n<br>\\nSearch terms: David Letterman, Johnny Carson, MTV, Headbangers Ball, Beavis, Petaluma<br>\\n<br>',\n",
